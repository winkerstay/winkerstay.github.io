    <h1> Activities!</h1>

    <div class="activitiesp">
        <p><span>There are tons of things to do at Anderson Lodge and in the surrounding parks!
            <br> We hope you will find your time there fun!</span>
            <br>
            <br> A variety of amenities are available at the lodge and includes children's books, toys, board games, play house, and playground to billiard tables, ping pong, fusbol, tennis, basketball, volleyball and a huge field to kick/throw a ball around or play frisbee tag.
            <br>
            <br> For those important leisure times, you can relax in the sauna, take a stroll on our trails, or hang out in one of the many outdoor seating areas. There also is a campfire amphitheatre which we hope to gather around every night. For activities outside of the lodge grounds, we have a day trip planned to a lava tube called Ape Cave and a hike to see Mt. St. Helen. If you're into water sports, kayaks and canoes rentals are available a few miles from the lodge. For those interested in scoping out some wineries, we'd recommend Bethany Vineyards and & Winery and Gouger Cellars.
