    <h1> Activities!</h1>

    <div class="activitiesp">
        <p><span>There are tons of things to do and see at and around Anderson Lodge!
            <br> We hope you will find your time there fun!</span>
            <br>
            <br> The Main Lodge itself has a variety of amenities. A glassed in sunroom with Tuscan tile sweeps the back of the lodge. The log-framed conference room and the spacious reception pavilion provide spectacular areas for large group gatherings. The conference is a cozy space that is fully carpeted with a log beam structure. Leather furniture, wood stove and upright piano give this room a homey feel. Anna’s Pavilion, with laminate flooring, is perfect for all events. It has a closed-off game room at one end and has as many windows as possible to capture the lush forest surrounding it. Three picturesque outdoor dining patios are nestled in the forest. There is seating for 125+ people on bistro chairs and tables.
            <br>
            <br> For those important leisure times, you can relax in the sauna, take a stroll on our trails, or play a variety of games: ping pong, billiards, volleyball, soccer, badminton, basketball, horseshoes, tennis and a children's playground to name a few. There also is a campfire amphitheatre which we hope to gather around every night.
