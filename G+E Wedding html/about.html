        <h1> Greg + Erica</h1>



        <p>We are so happy and excited to be able to celebrate our love and committment to each other surrounded by our family and friends.
            <br> Our story goes...
            <br> Erica and I met in New York City in late 2012. We worked in the same building in Soho, a five-story converted factory that housed aspiring artists, designers, architects, tech startups, fashionistas – and everyone's dog – in glass-walled offices. She was in a small L-shaped office on the fourth floor, and I on the fifth floor almost directly above her. I think she got to know my stomping before she met me. We passed each other a several times in the hallways until one day she found me in the lounge drinking mate, the Argentine tea, with a friend. We started to chat, introduced ourselves, and found that despite her Brazilian-ness and my love of Argentine culture we were to get along quite well. After a bit of light teasing, we both forgave each other for our cultural affinities and went our separate ways. Winter arrived and it was cold. A chance encounter trudging through a blizzard on Lafayette could have been the start of our relationship, but alas, she was heading to a hair appointment and I was getting a burrito. She insists that I missed the opportunity to invite her to eat with me – I insist that it was because of my cold feet. (Ba-dum tss!) The true connection happened in February. I was stepping out for a mid-afternoon coffee break when I caught her lounging about the front door. I invited her to join me for an espresso and cannoli at the Little Italy eatery a few blocks away and she joined me for a walk. When I came out with my Italian treats in hand, she popped the big question: would I, Greg, accompany her to see the Brooklyn Nets at Barclay's Stadium that evening? Of course of I said yes. Even though she insists it just started out as a friendly invite to see a friendly basketball game, I insist that this was our official first date. The game was fantastic. We had great seats a few rows back from the court, Jimmy Fallon was there, and the Nets won in a close, last-minute run that had us on our feet and cheering until the final second. At some point after leaving the stadium, I mentioned casually how the weather was nice enough to walk back to Manhattan, and Erica asked, well, why not? So we started walking, crossing the Manhattan bridge taking photos against the graffiti-covered backdrop to a dark East River below as noisy N trains made their way back to Brooklyn. At some point Erica wanted to climb a ladder into some bridge construction to get a cool shot, but I had to say no – what about cops! what if you fall! let's at least wait until our first real date! And that was the beginning of that. Well, all of the above is true. It did happen that way.

            <!--            A little over three years ago, I was working in a startup in NYC inside a community based office space called WeWork. The first time I saw Greg, he was sitting in the lounge area adjacent to my office. He was drinking mate with a fellow WeWorker from another office. My first thought was, "hmmmm, he looks Argentine." But I thought he was very good looking and gave off a good chill vibe, which I liked. But I wasn't interested then. I ran into him a time or two after that and always thought he was super nice, smart and cute. On February 19, 2013, I was outside our office building. He walked by and stopped to say hi. We ended up talking for a good 15 minutes or so before he invited me to get a cannoli with him, which I didn't want but I accompanied him anyway. That day, I had gotten an extra season ticket to see the Brooklyn Nets play at the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn. I had such a good time talking to him that I thought I'd invite him. He accepted. As time rolled around, I started getting very excited about seeing him again. We had a blast at the game, which the Nets won in overtime, with several last minute buzzer points. We walked across the Manhattan Bridge, where he deterred me from climbing a ladder-->
