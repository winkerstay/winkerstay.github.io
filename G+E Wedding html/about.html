        <h1> Greg + Erica</h1>



        <p>We are so happy and excited to be able to celebrate our love and committment to each other surrounded by our family and friends.
            <br> Our story goes...
            <br> A little over three years ago, I was working in a startup in NYC inside a community based office space called WeWork. The first time I saw Greg, he was sitting in the lounge area adjacent to my office. He was drinking mate with a fellow WeWorker from another office. My first thought was, "hmmmm, he looks Argentine." But I thought he was very good looking and gave off a good chill vibe, which I liked. But I wasn't interested then. I ran into him a time or two after that and always thought he was super nice, smart and cute. On February 19, 2013, I was outside our office building. He walked by and stopped to say hi. We ended up talking for a good 15 minutes or so before he invited me to get a cannoli with him, which I didn't want but I accompanied him anyway. That day, I had gotten an extra season ticket to see the Brooklyn Nets play at the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn. I had such a good time talking to him that I thought I'd invite him. He accepted. As time rolled around, I started getting very excited about seeing him again. We had a blast at the game, which the Nets won in overtime, with several last minute buzzer points. We walked across the Manhattan Bridge, where he deterred me from climbing a ladder
