        <h1> Greg + Erica</h1>


        <div class="aboutus">
            <p>We are so happy and excited to be able to celebrate our love and committment to each other surrounded by our family and friends.
                <br> Their story goes...
                <br>We met in New York City in late 2012 where we worked in the same building in Soho, a five-story converted factory that housed aspiring artists, designers, architects, tech startups, fashionistas – and everyone's dog – in glass-walled offices.
                <br>Erica was in a small L-shaped office on the fourth floor, and Greg on the fifth floor almost directly above her. Greg thinks she got to know his stomping before she actually met him. They passed each other a several times in the hallways until one day she found him in the lounge drinking mate, the Argentine tea, with a friend. They started to chat, introduced themselves, and found that despite her Brazilian-ness and his love of Argentine culture, they were to get along quite well. After a bit of light teasing, they both forgave each other for their cultural affinities and went their separate ways.

                <br> A few months later, on February 19, Erica ran into Greg on his afternoon coffee + cannoli break. After realizing how easy it was to talk to Greg, when he came out with his Italian treats in hand, she popped the big question: would you, Greg, accompany me to see the Brooklyn Nets at Barclay's Stadium that evening? Of course of Greg said yes. Even though Erica insists it just started out as a friendly invite to see a friendly basketball game, Greg insists that this was their official first date. With butterflies in her stomach, they met up to take the train to Brooklyn together.
                <br>The game was fantastic. With great seats a few rows back from the court and seeing Jimmy Fallon there, the Nets won in a close, last-minute run that had us on our feet and cheering until the final second. At some point after leaving the stadium, Greg mentioned casually how the weather was nice enough to walk back to Manhattan, and Erica asked, well, why not? And so they walked across Manhattan Bridge at 11pm.
                <br>At some point, Erica wanted to snap a picture of the NY skyline by climbing a scaffold but Greg instisted that she not climb up. From then on, we were inseperable. We started hanging out more and more, doing lots of fun things in NYC and enjoying the spring. She got him into longboarding. He got her into noodles. She got him into electronic music. He got her into classical. She got him to be more assertive. He got her to be more practical. He got her into pantsing and she pretty much pants him every day from then on out. Pretty soon, we had our favorite restaurants, cafes, craft-beer bars and established a Friday night date night where we would explore different things NYC had to offer. We went to many concerts, explored the parks in NYC and Brooklyn, took day trips outside the city and traveled together to many different places.
                <br> We soon met each other’s families and moved in together after one year. In June 2014, we decided to move to San Francisco so Greg could pursue his career in web development while Erica made plans to go back to school for Graphic Design.
                <br> In late October 2015, we took a weekend trip to Portland, Oregon. Little did Erica know, Greg was about to pop the big question. While hiking in Forest Park, in Portland, he tapped her shoulder and quickly asked, “Will you marry me?” extending the ring box to her. Erica, surprised and shocked asked him if he was joking. And then she said yes!!!
